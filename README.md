# Prediction-of-most-informative-view
Each product has multiple views (front, left, right, back) and only a few views have the information about the product through which you can make the ML model learn its features. This model select the specific view from the given set of different views.<br/>
For Example: In the case of footwear, Side view(left/right) has most information regarding the type of heel (high, medium or flat).Similarly, different views have different information for each use case.
